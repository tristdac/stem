  Scenario: Create, edit then preview a pattern match question.
    # Create a new question.
    And I add a "Pattern match" question filling the form with:

      | Question text                 | Listen, translate and write               |

      | id_synonymsdata_0_synonyms    | "testing\|one\|two\|three\|four"          |
      | Answer 1                      | match (testing one two three four)        |
