/**
 * This page allows responses to be tested against the rules contained in the question.
 * The user can select one or more responses, and have the computer mark these, or
 * delete them (so long as the user has edit capability).
 *
 * The grading statistics show how accurately the question has marked the currently
 * graded responses.
 *
 * The human mark is the bench mark by which the computer is judged and we assume
 * that the human mark is the correct mark to give.
 *
 * Authors are interested in how many times the computer mark matches the human mark.
 * Of the two values for pos and neg (e.g. Pos=0/21 Neg=49/51) the sum of the computer
 * marks is always on the left and the sum of the human marks is always on the right.
 *
 * The statistics (Pos=0/21 Neg=49/51 Unm=0 Acc=68%) therefore mean:
 * Pos  = Positive matches. The number of times the computer gave a positive grade (1) to
 *        match the human markers positive grade. e.g. The computer gave a positive grade
 *        to 0 of the 21 positive grades given by the human marker.
 * Neg =  Negative matches. The number of times the computer gave a negative grade (0) to
 *        match the human markers negative grade. e.g. the computer gave a negative grade
 *        (0) to 49 of the 51 negative grades given by the human marker.
 * Unm =  Unmarked responses. Responses that have not yet been graded by computer and are
 *        not yet part of the accuracy statistics.
 * Acc =  A percentage indicating the ability of the computer to accurately mark the
 *        responses compared to a human marker expressed as a percentage. It is a ratio
 *        of the number of times the computer gave the same mark as a human against the
 *        total number of marks the human gave.
 *        Which in this case is calculated as:
 *        * The number of times the computer grade matches the human grade:
 *          0 matched pos + 49 matched neg = 49 correct
 *        * The total number of possible grades: pos 21 + new 51 = 72
 *        * The computer question grading accuracy:
 *          The number of times the computer grade matches the human grade / The total
 *          number of possible grades
 *          49/72 as a percentage gives 68%
 *
 * The table of responses can be sorted, paged, and manipulated with the options in the top
 * section of the page.
